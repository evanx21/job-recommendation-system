# Job Recommendation System (AI & Data-Driven)

This project is a data-driven job recommendation system designed to explore how
computational methods and AI-assisted analysis can support decision-making in
job search and labor market matching.

The system integrates real-time job data, geolocation processing, and
AI-assisted text analysis to generate personalized job recommendations.

---

## Motivation

Job search is increasingly mediated by digital platforms, yet many systems
lack transparency and flexibility in how recommendations are generated.
This project was developed to examine how applied data science and AI
techniques can be used to build customizable, research-oriented recommendation
pipelines.

The project also serves as an example of translating a computational research
idea into a deployable digital system.

## Key Features

- Real-time job listing retrieval via external APIs
- AI-assisted analysis of job descriptions and keywords
- Geolocation-based filtering and processing
- Rule-based and data-driven recommendation logic
- Modular backend design for experimentation and extension

---

## System Architecture

1. Users provide job-related inputs (keywords, location, preferences)
2. External APIs fetch real-time job listings
3. AI services assist with text analysis and normalization
4. Recommendation logic ranks and filters job results
5. Processed results are returned through backend services

The architecture is designed to support iterative experimentation with
different data sources, ranking strategies, and AI-assisted workflows.

## Tech Stack

- **Backend:** Java, Servlet API, Apache Tomcat
- **Database:** MySQL
- **APIs:** SerpAPI, EdenAI, Geolocation APIs
- **Data Processing:** JSON parsing, filtering, ranking logic
- **Frontend:** JavaScript, HTML/CSS (basic interface)

## Research & Educational Relevance

This project demonstrates experience relevant to digitally-enabled research,
including:

- Building end-to-end computational pipelines
- Integrating heterogeneous data sources
- Applying AI tools in an applied research context
- Designing systems that support experimentation and extension
- Bridging software engineering with data-driven inquiry

The system can be adapted for future research exploring labor markets,
recommendation systems, or human-centered AI applications.
